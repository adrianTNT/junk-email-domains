Should be updated with list of domains that offer disposable / junk / temporary email accounts. These are a huge problem for mail servers, they cause too many bounces, decrease mail server reputation and so on.

This list was made unique and sorted alphabetically with simple tools from http://app.tntcode.com/tools/ 

The actual list is the */raw* file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrianTNT/junk-email-domains/master/raw
